# Keep Note Integration With NodeJS

## Context

Keep Note is a website that helps users capture their minds and allows them to add notes and lists. It also allows adding a reminder to make sure that the user never misses a thing. It is possible to add labels to notes to quickly organize and get on with it.  ​

Keep Note application allows only the registered users to add notes and access them. To persist user details and notes information, it must be stored in a database that should be highly secure and reliable. ​

Due to its growing popularity, the number of users accessing the application has increased multifold. For a seamless user experience, choosing the right database which performs well and provides data faster is the need of the hour. ​

MySQL database server is open-source database software that is faster, secured,  reliable and cheaper because of its unique storage engine architecture. ​

The backend development team is now responsible for persisting the application data in the MySQL database which ensures durability. ​
